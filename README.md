# Medi Assist

Medical Counseling, preventive treatment and remediation portal powered by TBD, DID, Trinsic, Ontology, Azero.ID, Polygon ID Defi and dev tooling, TBD blockchain and Web3 tools. Enable secure data storage; transparency of medical report data.

Automated Workflow for decentralized voting for service providers and DAOs using DID, TBD, Ontology, Trinsic and PolygonID:

- DAOs create an RFP for providing service or maintenance on the dapp.
- Doctor can join a RFP by minting an NFT of that RFP. This NFT is created using Ink.
- Doctors who have a certain RFP's NFT are eligible to create proposals and vote on them.
- Voting is gasless and the vote is stored on TBD, Polkadot, Polygon with the most recent vote linking to one before using TBD, PolygonID.

Further, we are developing TBD DAO tooling for hospitals. Please visit https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/Medical-Counselor/tree/main/hospital-DAO-astar#dao-tools-for-hospitals-using-ink-smart-contracts

DID-based Wallet to interact with the Ethereum, Polkadot/Substrate based blockchains through a browser with features like Account creation;

Security and asset management;

Creation and management of Escrows, with support for conditions;

Creation and management of Checks;

Creation and management of Offers.


Medical Counseling, preventive treatment and remediation portal for making personalized medicine more affordable and accessible. We provide secure data storage & transparency of medical counseling report data using Opentext APIs and decentralized data storage powered by DID, TBD, Ontology, Trinsic and PolygonID, Polkadot, Ink Smart Contracts IPFS, Chainlink Blockchain, Orthanc PACS (picture archiving and communication system) using NFT.storage, Chainlink VRF, XDC and Near Protocol. Our service aims to provide secure data storage, transparent data movement and data authenticity.

Our decentralized chat application enables medical counselling in a privacy preserved chat like interface (please visit  https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/12XyhbqvGHfTZPl_zbc9fO_rJUNvmIQHG )

# Features

Data Transparency: Availability of patient’s medical counseling records across different stakeholders through secure blockchain network. The platform utilizes decentralized storage and transactions, which enables patients and organizations to place their data on the exchange and decide and govern which consortium entities have permission to access information. Please visit https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/12XyhbqvGHfTZPl_zbc9fO_rJUNvmIQHG.

Data Uniformity: Data is processed to make it uniform and stored in PACS (Picture Archiving Communication System) so that it can be utilized by different stakeholders on verified requests. Also, records are encrypted to avoid any tampering of the data over the course of time.

Data Analytics: With the help of computer-aided detection and machine learning algorithms, data can be further used for analysis and early prediction on Chainlink Blockchain.

A greater and more seamless flow of information within a digital healthcare infrastructure, created by electronic health records (EHRs), encompasses and leverages digital progress and can transform the way care is delivered and compensated. EHRs help in improved care coordination. EHRs help in making the health care ecosystem proactive, accessible, and authentic. EHRs with the help of computer-aided detection will help in early prediction of diseases.

We are developing a technical solution using  decentralized data storage powered by TBD, DID, Trinsic, Ontology, Polygon ID and Biconomy blockchain, zksync Era, IPFS, Chainlink Blockchain and Lens Protocol, Orthanc PACS (picture archiving and communication system) using NFT.storage, Chainlink VRF, Magic SDK and Visa payments infrastructure, Filecoin/IPFS blockchain developer library along with Chainlink automation and Flow, XDC blockchain, Space and Time network, Truflation, open source spreadsheet engine to enable secure data storage, transparent data movement, and data authenticity and borrowing funds for drug design and development using collaterals on Chainlink network Biconomy and Onyx blockchain.
