# Medical-Counselor
Medical Counseling, preventive treatment and remediation portal using IPFS, NFT.Storage, Embark and Near Protocol. We provide secure data storage & transparency of medical counseling report data using decentralized data storage powered by IPFS, Orthanc PACS (picture archiving and communication system) using NFT.storage and Chainlink VRF and Near Protocol. Our service aims at providing secure data storage, transparent data movement and data authenticity.

Our decentralized chat application enables medical counselling in a privacy preserved chat like interface powered by IPFS using NFT.storage (please visit  https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/12XyhbqvGHfTZPl_zbc9fO_rJUNvmIQHG )

Features:

Data Transparency : Availability of patientâ€™s medical counseling records across different stakeholder through secure Ethereum blockchain network. The platform utilizes Ethereum blockchain, IPFS via NFT.Storage, Nucypher i.e. patients and organizations who place their data on the exchange will be able to control which consortium entities have permission to access information.

Data Uniformity : Data is processed to make it uniform and stored in PACS (Picture Archiving Communication System) so that it can be utilized by different stakeholders on verified request. Also records are encrypted to avoid any tampering of the data over course of time.

Data Analytics : With the help of computer aided detection and machine learning algorithms, data can be further used for analysis and early prediction.

A greater and more seamless flow of information within a digital health care infrastructure, created by electronic health records (EHRs), encompasses and leverages digital progress and can transform the way care is delivered and compensated. EHRs helps in improved care coordination. EHRs helps in making health care ecosystem proactive, accessible and authentic. EHRs with the help of computer aided detection will help in early prediction of diseases.
