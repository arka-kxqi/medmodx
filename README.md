# Medical-Counselor
Medical Counseling, preventive treatment and remediation portal for making personalized medicine more affordable and accessible. We provide secure data storage & transparency of medical counseling report data using decentralized data storage powered by IPFS, Orthanc PACS (picture archiving and communication system) using NFT.storage, Polkadot, Ink Smart Contracts, Chainlink VRF, XDC and Near Protocol. Our service aims at providing secure data storage, transparent data movement and data authenticity.

Our decentralized chat application enables medical counselling in a privacy preserved chat like interface (please visit  https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/12XyhbqvGHfTZPl_zbc9fO_rJUNvmIQHG )

# Features

Data Transparency : Availability of patientâ€™s medical counseling records across different stakeholder through secure Ethereum, Filecoin and XDC blockchain network. The platform utilizes Ethereum and XDC blockchain, IPFS via NFT.Storage, Nucypher i.e. patients and organizations who place their data on the exchange will be able to control which consortium entities have permission to access information. Please visit https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/12XyhbqvGHfTZPl_zbc9fO_rJUNvmIQHG.

Data Uniformity : Data is processed to make it uniform and stored in PACS (Picture Archiving Communication System) so that it can be utilized by different stakeholders on verified request. Also records are encrypted to avoid any tampering of the data over course of time.

Data Analytics : With the help of computer aided detection and machine learning algorithms, data can be further used for analysis and early prediction.

A greater and more seamless flow of information within a digital health care infrastructure, created by electronic health records (EHRs), encompasses and leverages digital progress and can transform the way care is delivered and compensated. EHRs helps in improved care coordination. EHRs helps in making health care ecosystem proactive, accessible and authentic. EHRs with the help of computer aided detection will help in early prediction of diseases.

We are developing a technical solution using Filecoin/IPFS blockchain developer library along with Chainlink automation and XDC blockchain network, open source spreadsheet engine to enable secure data storage, transparent data movement and data authenticity and borrowing XDC funds for drug design and development using collaterals on XDC network and Polkadot blockchain.

## Web3 Eco-system Tools

- XDC blockchain network: We are using XDC blockchain network to enable borrowing of XDC funds using collaterals for medical counseling and preventive treatment by patients with weaker economic conditions. Please visit: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/Medical-Counselor/tree/main/XDC-borrow-funds

- Covalent End Point: Covalent-NFT-Dashboard enables us to analyze, observe all NFTs from wallet address in different networks. Please visit https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/Medical-Counselor/tree/main/Covalent-NFT-Dashboard


## Chainlink

- Chainlink: We are utilizing Chainlink VRF as follows:

Medical Counselling Bill Generation: We are utilizing Chainlink Mix to work with Chainlink smart contracts. The bill script will deploy a smart contract to goerli and get a Random number via Chainlink VRF, which can used to identify a unique transaction/order number for the medical consulting bill.

Parametric Insurance Solution for patients with special needs. We are utilizing an existing example at chainlink github repo to develop an insurance solution for patients. Link: https://github.com/aspiringsecurity/Medical-Counselor/tree/main/Audit-Module
